                <p>Welcome to the CuriosJude Wiki! This is a place where I've gathered some unique and creepy creatures that I made out of boredom. 
                Each entity has its own unique apperance and filled with intriguing details and eeriie description. Feel free to explore the 
                lore behind these mysterious beings, and let your curiosity lead the way as you delve into the world I've conjured. 
                Enjoy the journey and thank you for visiting. 
                </p>

                <p>NOTE:(Just incase some who don't know how to read)These creatures are not real;
                         they are entirely fictional characters designed to entertain and spark your
                         imagination(or whatever). Have fun looking around.

                <h2>TYPES OF CREATURES</h2><hr>
                    <div class="info">
                        <h3>PASSIVE</h3>
                        <p>Passive creatures are those that avoid conflict and remain non-aggressive, exhibiting little to no reaction unless directly provoked. 
                            They tend to coexist peacefully within their environments, often displaying behaviors that prioritize avoidance and tranquility over confrontation.</p>

                        <br>
                            <div class="info">
                                <h3>NEUTRAL</h3>
                                <p>Neutral creatures maintain a balanced stance, not actively seeking out confrontation but remaining alert and willing to defend themselves if threatened.
                                They often interact with their surroundings without strong aggression or passivity, responding based on the situation rather than exhibiting a fixed behavior.</p>

                                        <h3>HOSTILE</h3>
                                        <p>Hostile creatures exhibit aggressive behavior and actively seek to attack or intimidate others. They are quick to react with hostility in response to perceived 
                                        threats or intrusions, often displaying fierce territoriality or defensive aggression. These creatures typically create a sense of danger in their environments, 
                                        posing challenges to those who encounter them.</p>
