                <h4>
                The Cool Guy has pale white skin, giving him an ethereal, almost ghostly look. His body is slightly<br>
                disfigured, with limbs that seem to bend at unusual angles, but this only adds to his mysterious charm.<br>
                He is always seen wearing a chill face mask, which adds to his aura of mystique, hiding his true <br>
                expressions. On his head, he sports a cool cap, tilted at a jaunty angle, which has become his signature style.<br>
                His outfit is casual and modern, reflecting his love for comfort and style.
